<h1>About Me</h1>
<h3>Anas bin Malik</h3><hr />

<p>I'm a Computer Science Engineering student with
   an immense enthusiasm towards technology. For the last few years, 
   Iâ€™ve learned the core fundamentals of computer science which includes 
   DSA, OOP, DBMS, etc. </p>

<p>I've completed <b>B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering</b> from GEC Palakkad
  with a CGPA of 8.36 in the academic duration of 2019-23. I've completed my 
  Higher Secondary Studies in Bio-Mathematics from DHSS Nellipuzha with 97.75%.
</p>

<p>I've worked on projects <b>"Task Management & Performance Analysis"</b> 
  and <b>"Real-time helmet detection using OpenCV and TensorFlow"</b>. The former project
  implements the assigning and managing of various tasks in a company and analysing the performance
  of the employees and the latter project provides a self-awareness to rider by beeping an alarm if rider or pioneer rider
  doesn't wear helmet rather than providing information to a   third party like MVD, Police etc. 
</p>

<p>I'm familiar with languages English and Malayalam. I've mastered multiple programming languages like <b>C, Java and Python</b> as well as 
  testing and debugging. Currently I'm specialising in Web Development and Machine Learning. </p>
